If you are like most people I know (and, since you're reading this book, you probably are -- at least in this respect), you use the Web. A lot. In fact, in my own personal case, the vast majority of my days are spent reading or scanning web pages -- a scroll through my webmail client to talk with friends and colleagues, a weblog or two to catch up on the news of the day, a dozen short articles, a flotilla of Google queries, and the constant turn to Wikipedia for a stray fact to answer a nagging question.

> 如果你和我认识的大多数人相像的话（鉴于你正在读这本书，那绝对就是了），你一定经常使用互联网。拿我自己来说，我生活中大部分时间都是在阅读网页中度过 — 通过邮件客户端与朋友／同事们聊天，翻几篇网络博客来获取新闻，还有成堆的短篇文章和那些想 Google 的条目，有时还会为一些老生常谈的问题跑去 Wikipedia 找答案考究。

All fine and good, of course; indeed, nigh indispensable. And yet, it is sobering to think that little over a decade ago none of this existed. Email had its own specialized applications, weblogs had yet to be invented, articles were found on paper, Google was yet unborn, and Wikipedia not even a distant twinkle in Larry Sanger's eye.

> 我列举的这些行为，如今都再正常不过了，同时在我们的生活中也不可或缺。不过回想一下，10 年以前这些事情是不存在的：那时电子邮件还要用专门的软件来打开，网络博客还没被发明，看文章还停留在纸张上，Google 还未诞生，甚至连 Wikipedia 这个项目都还没在 Larry Sanger 的脑海里飘过。

And so, it is striking to consider -- almost shocking, in fact -- what the world might be like when our software turns to the Web just as frequently and casually as we do. Today, of course, we can see the faint, future glimmers of such a world. There is software that phones home to find out if there's an update. There is software where part of its content -- the help pages, perhaps, or some kind of catalog -- is streamed over the Web. There is software that sends a copy of all your work to be stored on the Web. There is software specially designed to help you navigate a certain kind of web page. There is software that consists of _nothing but_ a certain kind of web page. There is software -- the so-called "mashups" -- that consists of a web page combining information from two other web pages. And there is software that, using "APIs", treats other web sites as just another part of the software infrastructure, another function it can call to get things done.

> 细想上述改变的确令人吃惊，甚至有些震惊。而当这些软件变得像网页一样频繁且日常，世界将会是什么样子？在今天，这个未来世界就已初现端倪。现在我们能够通过一些应用拨打电话更进信息，有些应用的帮助页面或目录在网上四处蔓延，有些则能将你的工作成果拷贝并存储到互联网上。也有些应用为你特别定制，为你找出所需的网页，或者就只包含一些特定网页。有一类应用，即所谓的“内容混搭（mashups)”，其实也就是把不同网页的内容放进一个网页中，使内容图文并茂。还有另一种应用，通过，“应用程序接口(APIs)”, 将其他网站当作一种软件架构中每个组成的小部分，比如当需要用到某个网站的功能时，去找对应的接口请求数据就好了。

Our computers are so small and the Web so great and vast that this last scenario seems like part of an inescapable trend. Why _wouldn't_ you depend on other web sites whenever you could, making their endless information and bountiful abilities a seamless part of yours? And so, I suspect, such uses will become increasingly common until, one day, your computer is as tethered to the Web as you yourself are now.

> 相比功能宏大的互联网，我们的电脑显得如此渺小，上述最后例子即是一个不可避免的趋势。当你需要的时候，为什么不利用其他网站呢？为什么不把其他网站上无穷无尽的信息和丰富多样的功能化为己有？正是如此，我猜互联网的这些用途会变得十分普遍，直到一天你的电脑已被互联网紧紧拴住，正如你已经离不开电脑了一样。

It is sometimes suggested that such a future is impossible, that making a Web that other computers could use is the fantasy of some (rather unimaginative, I would think) sci-fi novelist. That it would only happen in a world of lumbering robots and artificial intelligence and machines that follow you around, barking orders while intermittently unsuccessfully attempting to persuade you to purchase a new pair of shoes.

> 有时候，人们说这样的未来不可能存在，创造一个让其他计算机自身也可以使用的互联网只是某些（很难想象，我觉得）科幻小说家的幻想罢了。那只会发生在一个未来世界，那个世界充满了笨重的机器人、人工智能设备和各种机械。它们跟随着你、间歇地向你叫喊着，试图说服你购买一双新鞋。

So it is perhaps unsurprising that one of the critics who has expressed something like this view, Cory Doctorow, is in fact a rather imaginative sci-fi novelist (amongst much else). Doctorow's complaint is expressed in his essay "Metacrap: Putting the torch to seven straw-men of the meta-utopia"[^mc].

> 在这些批评者之中，有一位表达了类似的观点，也不足为奇。Cory Doctorow 是一个富有想象力的科幻小说家（相比其他而言）。Doctorow 的批评意见表达在他的文章《元垃圾：把火把放在七个元乌托邦稻草人上》中。

Doctorow argues that any system collect accurate "metadata" -- the kind of machine-processable data that will be needed to make this dream of computers-using-the-Web come true -- will run into seven inescapable problems: people lie, people are lazy, people are stupid, people don't know themselves, schemas aren't neutral, metrics influence results, and there's more than one way to describe something. Instead, Doctorow proposes that instead of trying to get people to provide data, we should instead look at the data they produce incidentally while doing other things (like how Google looks at the links people make when they write web pages) and use that instead.

> Doctorow 提出，任何系统，如果试图去收集准确的 “元数据”（一种机器也可以处理的、能让 “计算机使用互联网” 成为现实的数据），将会陷入七个不可避免的问题中：人们提供假数据、人们懒于处理数据、人们提供错误的信息、人们不了解自身、一些数据模式并不中立、衡量事情的方式影响了结果，以及，描述同一个东西存在多种方式。相反，Docorow 建议，与其让人们主动提供数据，不如多多关注人们做其他事情的时候，偶然产生的数据（就像 Google 看待人们编写网页时创造的各种超链接一样），然后用这些数据来替代准确的 “元数据”。

Doctorow is, of course, attacking a strawman. Utopian fantasies of honest, complete, unbiased data about everything are obviously impossible. But who was trying for that anyway? The Web is rarely perfectly honest, complete, and unbiased -- but it's still pretty damn useful. There's no reason making a Web for computers to use can't be the same way.

> Doctorow 所攻讦当然是一些假想敌，因为完整可信且足够精确的数据显然只是乌托邦式的幻想。那些努力营造这一幻想的人可能会想，互联网几乎不能完全达到以上要求，但依然已经非常实用，如法炮制一个为计算机定制的网络也足够可行。

I have to say, however, the idea's proponents do not escape culpability for these utopian perceptions. Many of them have gone around talking about the "Semantic Web" in which our computers would finally be capable of "machine understanding". Such a framing (among other factors) has attracted refugees from the struggling world of artificial intelligence, who have taken it as another opportunity to promote their life's work.

> 然而我必须指出，以上想法的追随者要为这个乌托邦幻想负责。这其中一些人肆意讨论能让计算机最终能够实现“机器理解”的“语义网”。这样的网络架构吸引了很多在人工智能世界里挣扎的难民，这些人把语义网当做推动他们毕生心血的另一途径。

Instead of the "let's just build something that works" attitude that made the Web (and the Internet) such a roaring success, they brought the formalizing mindset of mathematicians and the institutional structures of academics and defense contractors. They formed committees to form working groups to write drafts of ontologies that carefully listed (in 100-page Word documents) all possible things in the universe and the various properties they could have, and they spent hours in Talmudic debates over whether a washing machine was a kitchen appliance or a household cleaning device.

> “构造一些有用的东西”，这一态度曾让互联网获得了巨大成功，而上述这些人并非如此秉持这一观念。他们带给互联网的，是数学家们的固定思维，以及学者和国防承包商那样墨守成规的结构体系。他们为工作小组设立委员会，在长达100页的word文档里详细列举了有关语义本体的所有可能性，以及它们可能拥有的各种性质。（因执着于探究事物的本质），他们花费数小时进行塔木德式辩论，仅仅为了争论洗衣机在本质上到底属于厨房配件，还是清洁设备。

With them has come academic research and government grants and corporate R&D and the whole apparatus of people and institutions that scream "pipedream". And instead of spending time building things, they've convinced people interested in these ideas that the first thing we need to do is write _standards_. (To engineers, this is absurd from the start -- standards are things you write _after_ you've got something working, not before!)

And so the "Semantic Web Activity" at the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) has spent its time writing standard upon standard: the Extensible Markup Language (XML), the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Web Ontology Language (OWL), tools for Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages (GRDDL), the Simple Protocol And RDF Query Language (SPARQL) (as created by the RDF Data Access Working Group (DAWG)).

Few have received any widespread use and those that have (XML) are uniformly scourges on the planet, offenses against hardworking programmers that have pushed out sensible formats (like JSON) in favor of overly-complicated hairballs with no basis in reality (I'm not done yet! -- more on this in chapter 5).

Instead of getting existing systems to talk to each other and writing up the best practices, these self-appointed guarantors of the Semantic Web have spent their time creating their own little universe, complete with Semantic Web databases and programming languages. But databases and programming languages, while far from perfect, are largely solved problems. People already have their favorites, which have been tested and hacked to work in all sorts of unusual environments, and folks are not particularly inclined to learn a new one, especially for no good reason. It's hard enough getting people to share data as it is, harder to get them to share it in a particular format, and completely impossible to get them to store it and manage it in a completely new system.

And yet this is what Semantic Webheads are spending their time on. It's as if to get people to use the Web, they started writing a new operating system that had the Web built-in right at the core. Sure, we might end up there someday, but insisting that people do that from the start would have doomed the Web to obscurity from the beginning.[^dt]

All of which has led "web engineers" (as this series' title so cutely calls them) to tune out and go back to doing real work, not wanting to waste their time with things that don't exist and, in all likelihood, never will. And it's led many who have been working on the Semantic Web, in the vain hope of actually building a world where software can communicate, to burnout and tune out and find more productive avenues for their attentions.

For an example, look at Sean B. Palmer. In his influential piece, "Ditching the Semantic Web?"[^dt], he proclaims "It's not prudent, perhaps even not moral (if that doesn't sound too melodramatic), to work on RDF, OWL, SPARQL, RIF, the broken ideas of distributed trust, CWM, Tabulator, Dublin Core, FOAF, SIOC, and any of these kinds of things" and says not only will he "stop working on the Semantic Web" but "I will, moreover, actively dissuade anyone from working on the Semantic Web where it distracts them from working on" more practical projects.)

[^dt]: Available online at .

It would be only fair here to point out that I am not exactly an unbiased observer. For one thing, Sean, like just about everyone else I cite in the book, is a friend. We met through working on these things together but since have kept in touch and share emails about what we're working on and are just generally nice to each. And the same goes for almost all the other people I cite and criticize.

Moreover, the reason we were working together is that I too did my time in the Semantic Web salt mines. My first web application was a collaboratively-written encyclopedia, but my second aggregated news headlines from sites around the Web, leading me into a downward spiral that ended with many years spent on RDF Core Working Groups and an ultimate decision to get out of the world of computers altogether.

Obviously, that didn't work out quite as planned. Jim Hendler, another friend and one of the AI transplants I've just spend so much time taking a swing at, asked me if I'd write a bit on the subject to kick off a new series of electronic books he's putting together. I'll do just about anything for a little cash (just kidding; I just wanted to get published (just kidding; I've been published plenty of times times (just kidding; not that many times (just kidding; I've never been published (just kidding; I have, but I just wanted more practice (just kidding; I practice plenty (just kidding; I never practice (just kidding; I just wanted to publish a book (just kidding; I just wanted to _write_ a book (just kidding; it's easy to write a book (just kidding; it's a death march (just kidding; it's not so bad (just kidding; my girlfriend left me (just kidding; I left her (just kidding, just kidding, just kidding))))))))))))))) and so here I am again, rehashing all the old ground and finally getting my chance to complain about what a mistake all the Semantic Web folks have made.

Yet, as my little thought experiment above has hopefully made clear, the programmable web is anything but a pipe dream -- it is today's reality and tomorrow's banality. No software developer will remain content to limit themselves only to things on the user's own computer. And no web site developer will be content to limit their site only to users who act with it directly.

Just as the interlinking power of the World Wide Web sucked all available documents into its maw -- encouraging people to digitize them, convert them into HTML, give them a URL, and put them on the Internet (hell, as we speak Google is even doing this to _entire libraries_) -- the programmable Web will pull all applications within its grasp. The benefits that come from being connected are just too powerful to ultimately resist.

They will, of course, be grant challenges to business models -- as new technologies always our -- especially for those who make their money off of gating up and charging access to data. But such practices simply aren't tenable in the long term, legally or practically (let alone morally). Under US law, facts aren't copyrightable (thanks to the landmark Supreme Court decision in _Feist v. Rural Telephone Service_) and databases are just collections of facts. (Some European countries have special database rights, but such extensions have been fervently opposed in the US.)

But even if the law didn't get in the way, there's so much value in sharing data that most data providers will eventually come around. Sure, providing a website where people can look things up can be plenty valuable, but it's nothing compared to what you can do when you combine that information with others.

To take an example from my own career, look at the website OpenSecrets.org. It collects information about who's contributing money to US political candidates and displays nice charts and tables about the industries that have funded the campaigns of presidential candidates and members of Congress.

Similarly, the website Taxpayer.net provides a wealth of information about Congressional earmarks -- the funding requests that members of Congress slip into bills, requiring a couple million dollars be given to someone for a particular pet project. (The $398 million "Bridge to Nowhere" being the most famous example.)

Both are fantastic sites and are frequently used by observers of American politics, to good effect. But imagine how much better they would be if you put them together -- you could search for major campaign contributors who had received large earmarks.

Note that this isn't the kind of "mashup" that can be achieved with today's APIs. APIs only let you look at the data in a particular way, typically the way that the hosting site looks at it. So with OpenSecrets' API you can get a list of the top contributors to a candidate. But this isn't enough for the kind of question we're interested in -- you'd need to compare each earmark against each donor to see if they match. It requires real access to the data.

Note also that the end result is ultimately in everyone's best interest. OpenSecrets.org wants people to find out about the problematic influence of money in politics. Taxpayer.net wants to draw attention to this wasteful spending. The public wants to know how money in politics causes wasteful spending and a site that helps them do so would further each organization's goals. But they can only get there if they're willing to share their data.

Fortunately for us, the Web was designed with this future in mind. The protocols that underpin it are not designed simply to provide pages for human consumption, but also to easily accommodate the menagerie of spiders, bots, and scripts that explore its fertile soil. And the original developers of the Web, the men and women who invented the tools that made it the life-consuming pastime that it is today, have long since turned their sights towards making the Web safe, even inviting, for applications.

Unfortunately, far too few are aware of this fact, leading many to reinvent -- sloppily -- the work that they have already done. (It hasn't helped that the few who are aware have spent their time working on the Semantic Web nonsense that I criticized above.) So we will begin by trying to understand the architecture of the Web -- what it got right and, occasionally, what it got wrong, but most importantly _why_ it is the way it is. We will learn how it allows both users and search engines to co-exist peacefully while supporting everything from photo-sharing to financial transactions.

We will continue by considering what it means to build a program on top of the Web -- how to write software that both fairly serves its immediate users as well as the developers who want to build on top of it. Too often, an API is bolted on top of an existing application, as an afterthought or a completely separate piece. But, as we'll see, when a web application is designed properly, APIs naturally grow out of it and require little effort to maintain.

Then we'll look into what it means for your application to be not just another tool for people and software to use, but part of the ecology -- a section of the programmable web. This means exposing your data to be queried and copied and integrated, even without explicit permission, into the larger software ecosystem, while protecting users' freedom.

Finally, we'll close with a discussion of that much-maligned phrase, "the Semantic Web", and try to understand what it would really mean.

Let's begin.
